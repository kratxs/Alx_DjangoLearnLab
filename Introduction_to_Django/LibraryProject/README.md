# Django Shell CRUD Operations with the Book Model

This document outlines the process of performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the `Book` model using Django's ORM through the Django shell.

---

## 1. Setting Up the Django Shell

```bash
$ python manage.py shell
```

This command launches the Django interactive shell, allowing us to interact with the database using Python commands.

---

## 2. Importing the Book Model

```python
>>> from bookshelf.models import Book
```

Before performing any CRUD operations, we need to import the `Book` model from our `bookshelf` app.

---

## 3. Creating a New Book Record

### Command:

```python
>>> # Creating a new book
>>> new_book = Book.objects.create(
...     title="1984",
...     author="George Orwell",
...     publication_year=1949
... )
```

### Explanation:

- **`Book.objects.create()`**: This method is used to create a new record in the `Book` table.
- **Parameters**:
  - `title="1984"`: The title of the book.
  - `author="George Orwell"`: The author of the book.
  - `publication_year=1949`: The year the book was published.

### Verifying the Creation:

```python
>>> all_books = Book.objects.all()
>>> for book in all_books:
...     print(book.title, book.author, book.publication_year)
...
1984 George Orwell 1949
```

- **`Book.objects.all()`**: Retrieves all the records in the `Book` table.
- **`for book in all_books:`**: Iterates through the queryset to print out the details of each book.

## 4. Retrieving All Book Records

### Command:

```python
>>> from bookshelf.models import Book
>>> # Retrieve command
>>> all_books = Book.objects.all()
>>> for book in all_books:
...     print(book.title, book.author, book.publication_year)
...
```

### Explanation:

- This command sequence retrieves all book records stored in the database and prints each book's title, author, and publication year.

### Output:

```python
1984 George Orwell 1949
```

---

## 5. Updating an Existing Book Record

### Command:

```python
>>> # Updating the title of the book
>>> book = Book.objects.get(title="1984")
>>> # Update Command
>>> book.title = "Nineteen Eighty-Four"
>>> book.save() # Saving the changes to the database
```

### Explanation:

- **`Book.objects.get(title="1984")`**: Fetches the specific book record where the title is "1984".
- **Updating**: The `title` field is updated to "Nineteen Eighty-Four".
- **Saving**: The `book.save()` method persists the changes to the database.

### Verifying the Update:

```python
>>> books = Book.objects.all()
>>> for book in books:
...     print(book.title, book.author, book.publication_year)
...
Nineteen Eighty-Four George Orwell 1949
```

- This verifies that the book title was successfully updated.

---

## 6. Deleting a Book Record

### Command:

```python
>>> # Deleting a record
>>> # Fetching the book record
>>> book = Book.objects.get(title="Nineteen Eighty-Four")
>>> # Delete Command
>>> book.delete()
(1, {'bookshelf.Book': 1})
```

### Explanation:

- **Fetching**: The specific book record is fetched using `Book.objects.get(title="Nineteen Eighty-Four")`.
- **Deleting**: The `book.delete()` command deletes the fetched record from the database.
- **Output**: `(1, {'bookshelf.Book': 1})` indicates that one record was successfully deleted.
